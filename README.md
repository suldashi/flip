This is a simple design for a 2 player board game, where the objective is for a player to get a row of all white tiles or all black tiles. The initial board is a 6x6 alternating pattern (same as a chessboard). A player can flip only an entire row or entire column at a time.

Development of this project is discontinued, as playtesting showed that the game was not very strategic or fun.
